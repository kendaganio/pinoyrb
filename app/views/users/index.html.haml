  %h1 Ruby Users
  %p Here is a list of Rubyists (and some non-Rubyists) who have volunteered to talk about Ruby and Ruby development related topics in the monthly meetups:

  %ul.user-list
    - @users.each do |user|
      %li
        %strong= link_to user.name, user
        - unless user.presentations.count < 1
          = pluralize user.presentations.count, "talk"
